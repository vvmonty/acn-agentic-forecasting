  news — phrase cutoff-aware queries, decide what is worth searching for, and

# Research playbook

A short guide to getting real signal out of `search_web`. This is a starter
skill — extend it with the queries and sources that work for your problem.

## The one rule that matters

Always pass `cutoff_date` equal to the `as_of` date in your payload. It is the
temporal fence that keeps post-origin information out of a historical forecast.
A forecast that "knew" what happened after `as_of` is not a forecast.

On historical origins (strictly before today's date), `search_web` runs an
independent verifier on every result and returns
`[SEARCH_VERIFICATION_FAILED]` instead of content it couldn't confirm as
pre-cutoff. Treat that as no verified news for the query — proceed on your
other signals and say so, never filling the gap from your own background
knowledge. On a live origin (`as_of` is today), the verifier is skipped so
current news is not stripped.

## How to search

- **Search before you forecast, not after.** Gather context first, then reason.
- **One topic per query.** Several focused queries beat one broad one. Stop when
  new queries stop returning new facts.
- **Ask for the present state, not a prediction.** "current OPEC+ production
  policy" returns facts; "will oil go up" returns noise.
- **Weigh sources.** Prefer primary releases and major outlets; treat a single
  blog or forum post as a lead to confirm, not a fact.

## Domain focus (edit this for your use case)

For WTI crude, the signals that move price: OPEC+ supply decisions, Persian
Gulf / shipping-lane geopolitical risk, US SPR and inventory data, USD strength,
and global demand outlook. Search for the *current state* of these, then let the
price history tell you the baseline.

## Room to grow

- Add a curated list of go-to sources for your domain.
- Track which queries paid off and prune the ones that didn't.
- Add a `references/` file with example high-signal searches.
