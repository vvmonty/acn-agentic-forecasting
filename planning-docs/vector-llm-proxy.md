# Vector LLM Proxy

Status: **implemented** — May 2026. The proxy is now the default routing layer for all LLM calls in `aieng.forecasting`.

> **Previously known limitation (now fixed):** Gemini thinking models dropped `thoughtSignature` in multi-turn tool calls. Fixed by the Vector team on May 28 2026 — see the history section at the bottom.

## What it is

Vector runs a shared LLM gateway at `proxy.vectorinstitute.ai`. It is OpenAI-API-compatible and supports a fixed list of Claude, Gemini, and OpenAI models. Model names are bare (no provider prefix): e.g. `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`, `gpt-4o-mini`.

## How it is wired in

- **All model strings are bare** (e.g. `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`). No `gemini/` or `openai/` prefix in user-facing config. Internally, the library prepends `openai/` before passing to LiteLLM so it routes via the OpenAI-compatible path; LiteLLM strips the prefix before sending to the proxy.
- **LLMP predictors** (`SampledTrajectoryLLMPredictor`, `QuantileGridLLMPredictor`): `LLMPredictorConfig` reads `OPENAI_BASE_URL` and `OPENAI_API_KEY` from the environment and passes them as `api_base`/`api_key` to `litellm.acompletion`.
- **ADK agents** (`build_adk_agent`): `AgentConfig` reads the same env vars. When `openai_base_url` is set and `model` is a plain string, the factory automatically wraps it in `LiteLlm(model="openai/<model>", api_base=..., api_key=...)`.
- **Web search / context retrieval**: replaced the Gemini-native `google_search` sub-agent with a `search_web` FunctionTool backed by the proxy's `{"googleSearch": {}}` server-side extension. Grounding metadata (source URLs) is extracted from `choices[0].provider_specific_fields["grounding_metadata"]`.
- **Default model everywhere**: the lite model (`gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`). See the project model convention below.

## Project model convention

To keep examples consistent for bootcamp participants, the project standardizes on **exactly two** proxy models:

| Role | Model | Used by |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Lite / default** | `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` | All LLMP and agent defaults, library defaults, web-search sub-tool (`search_model`), and the forecasting/intro notebooks. |
| **Advanced** | `gemini-3.5-flash` | The adaptive-agent path (`build_wti_adaptive_*`), the protected-eval and adaptive-training notebooks, and curriculum data-generation scripts. |

Both are defined once in `aieng.forecasting.models` as `LITE_MODEL` and `ADVANCED_MODEL` (with `DEFAULT_MODEL = LITE_MODEL`). **Reference these constants in code instead of hardcoding model strings** — a model swap is then a one-line change in that module. Notebooks set their model variable to one literal of the two, with the other shown as a commented alternative.

## Required environment variables

```
OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://proxy.vectorinstitute.ai/v1
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
```

Both are read via `os.getenv(...)` with `None` as the fallback. If neither is set, callers fall back to direct provider routing via LiteLLM's standard env vars (`GEMINI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, etc.).

## What was removed

- `gemini_native` code execution provider — E2B is the only sandbox now.
- ADK `google_search` tool + `GoogleSearchAgentTool` sub-agent pattern.
- `BuiltInCodeExecutor`, `ToolConfig`, `GoogleSearchAgentTool`, `google_search` imports from `agent_factory.py`.

## Routing decision table

| Need | Route |
| --- | --- |
| LLMP forecasting calls | Proxy — `LLMPredictorConfig` with `openai_base_url`/`openai_api_key` |
| ADK analyst/reasoning agent | Proxy — `AgentConfig` auto-wraps model in `LiteLlm` |
| Web search / context retrieval | Proxy — `search_web` tool uses `{"googleSearch": {}}` extension |
| Code execution | E2B sandbox (`CodeExecutionConfig(enabled=True)`) |

## Supported proxy models (May 2026)

`claude-opus-4-6`, `claude-opus-4-7`, `claude-sonnet-4-6`, `gemini-2.5-flash`, `gemini-2.5-flash-lite`, `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`, `gemini-3.1-pro-preview`, `gemini-3-flash-preview`, `gemini-3-pro-preview`, `gpt-4o`, `gpt-4o-mini`, `gpt-5.4`, `gpt-5.4-mini`, `gpt-5.5`.

## History: thoughtSignature issue with Gemini thinking models (resolved May 28 2026)

### What happened

When we first integrated the proxy we discovered that `gemini-3-flash-preview` (and likely other high-thinking-budget Gemini models) would fail on the second turn of any multi-turn tool call with:

> "Function call is missing a thought_signature in functionCall parts."

### Root cause

The proxy is OpenAI-API-compatible. When a Gemini thinking model generates a function call, its native response payload carries a `thoughtSignature` on each `functionCall` part:

```json
{
  "parts": [
    {"thought": true, "text": "I should search for..."},
    {
      "functionCall": {"name": "search_web", "args": {"query": "..."}},
      "thoughtSignature": "AUMFggIGCwQFBA..."
    }
  ]
}
```

OpenAI format has no slot for `thoughtSignature`, so the proxy's outbound translation dropped it. When ADK sent the tool result back in the next turn, the reconstructed Gemini-format history was missing the signature and Gemini rejected it.

### Workaround we applied

Temporarily changed the default model to `gemini-2.5-flash`, which did not exhibit the issue.

### Fix

The Vector team fixed the proxy's translation layer on May 28 2026 to preserve `thoughtSignature` through the round-trip. Both `gemini-3-flash-preview` and `gemini-2.5-flash` now pass multi-turn tool-call tests. Default model restored to `gemini-3-flash-preview`.

**Takeaway for future issues:** report proxy compatibility problems to the Vector team rather than working around them — the proxy is actively maintained and issues get fixed quickly.

## History: set_model_response shim for LiteLlm agents (May 28 2026)

### What happened

After the `thoughtSignature` fix, agents using `output_schema` together with tools raised a different error:

> `ValueError: Tool 'set_model_response' not found. Available tools: search_web`

### Root cause

ADK normally injects a `SetModelResponseTool` into agents that have both `output_schema` and other tools, because models need a way to submit structured output alongside a tool-call history. For native Gemini models ADK recognises the capability and injects automatically. For `LiteLlm` models it skips injection, assuming `response_format` is sufficient. However, Gemini thinking models (`gemini-3-flash-preview`) are trained to call `set_model_response` regardless, so the call lands with no registered tool to handle it.

The obvious fix — register ADK's `SetModelResponseTool` explicitly — fails immediately:

> `BadRequestError: Invalid JSON payload received. Unknown name "$defs" at 'tools[0].function_declarations[1].parameters'`

`SetModelResponseTool` builds its function declaration from the full nested Pydantic output schema, which uses JSON Schema `$defs`/`$ref` for references. Gemini's `function_declarations` format does not support references — all schemas must be flat.

### Fix

A flat-schema shim is registered in `agent_factory.py` when a `LiteLlm` agent has both `output_schema` and other tools:

```python
async def set_model_response(json_response: str, tool_context: ToolContext) -> str:
    """Submit your final structured JSON response as a string."""
    tool_context.state[SMR_STATE_KEY] = json_response
    return "Response submitted. Task complete."
```

The shim accepts the JSON as a plain string — no nested schema, no `$defs`. The model calls it, the JSON is stored in ADK session state under `SMR_STATE_KEY`. `AdkTextRunner.run_and_resolve()` reads that key after each run and returns the captured JSON in preference to the model's subsequent "Task complete." text response.

### Model-agnostic design — Gemini and Claude handled identically in code

There is no `if gemini … else claude …` branching. The shim registration condition is simply `isinstance(model, LiteLlm) and tools and output_schema` — true for any model routed through the proxy, regardless of provider.

| Model | Why it calls `set_model_response` |
|---|---|
| Gemini thinking models | Trained on ADK patterns; calls it reflexively in structured-output + tool-calling contexts, with or without the instruction |
| Claude | No ADK training, but is a strong instruction-follower; the explicit "call `set_model_response`" in the system prompt is sufficient |

In both cases the model calls the same flat-schema shim, which stores the JSON in session state. `run_and_resolve()` reads the key and returns the captured JSON.

The **fallback path** — `run_and_resolve()` returning `drain_run` text when the session state key is absent — catches any model that outputs plain JSON text instead of calling the tool. No special-casing required.

### Single source of truth for the schema description

Each `AgentForecastOutput` subclass exposes a `prompt_schema_json()` classmethod that returns the exact JSON template the model must pass to `set_model_response`. Agent instructions consume this classmethod rather than hardcoding the schema, so field-name changes and `STANDARD_QUANTILES` updates propagate automatically.

## History: reasoning_effort silently dropped by LiteLLM on proxy path (resolved May 28 2026)

### What happened

`QuantileGridLLMPredictor` with `reasoning_effort="low"` and model `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` was producing truncated JSON responses even after `max_tokens` was raised to 8192. The response always ended mid-value on the last quantile of an early horizon, with errors like:

> `Expecting ',' delimiter: line 27 column 17 (char 473)`

### Root cause

Through the proxy path, LiteLLM routes calls with `api_base` set using `custom_llm_provider='openai'` and prepends `openai/` to the model name. With `drop_params=True`, LiteLLM checks whether each parameter is in the supported-params list for the `openai` provider + model name. `reasoning_effort` is only listed as supported for o1/o3 model names:

```python
litellm.get_supported_openai_params("gemini-3.1-pro-preview", "openai")
# → [..., "max_tokens", "temperature", ...] — reasoning_effort NOT present
```

Because `gemini-3.1-pro-preview` doesn't look like an o1/o3 model, LiteLLM silently stripped `reasoning_effort` before the request reached the proxy. The proxy never saw the constraint; the thinking model ran fully unconstrained and consumed 7000–8000 thinking tokens per call. Thinking tokens and text output tokens share the same `max_tokens` budget through the OpenAI-compatible proxy, leaving only ~1000 tokens for a 12-horizon × 11-quantile JSON payload (~1600 tokens needed).

### Fix

Inject `reasoning_effort` via `extra_body` when routing through the proxy (`api_base` is set). `extra_body` fields are merged directly into the request JSON and bypass LiteLLM's param-filtering step entirely:

```python
if api_base is not None:
    kwargs.setdefault("extra_body", {})["reasoning_effort"] = reasoning_effort
else:
    kwargs["reasoning_effort"] = reasoning_effort
```

`max_tokens` was also raised from 4096 → 16384 as a defence-in-depth measure: even if `reasoning_effort` is somehow not honoured by a future proxy change, 16384 gives enough headroom for thinking models (the model only generates tokens it needs, so non-thinking models are unaffected in cost). Both food CPI recipe functions now expose `max_tokens` as an explicit parameter so participants can tune it per-model.

### Takeaway

When using `drop_params=True` with LiteLLM via an OpenAI-compatible proxy, **any parameter not in the provider's known-supported list for that model name will be silently dropped**. This is especially subtle for thinking-model parameters (`reasoning_effort`, future analogues) because the model name does not reveal that it is a thinking model. Prefer `extra_body` for pass-through parameters when the proxy is the actual target.

## History: proxy tightened `reasoning_effort` vocabulary and `response_schema` (June 2026)

### What happened

LLM-Process calls that had been working began returning `400 BadRequest` from the proxy, in two independent ways:

1. **`reasoning_effort`** — the Gemini route started rejecting `'disable'` and `'low'`:
   > `'reasoning_effort' does not support 'disable'; valid values: ['minimal', 'medium', 'high']`

   Empirically, for `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview` the proxy now accepts `None` (omit the field), `'minimal'`, `'medium'`, `'high'`, and **rejects** `'disable'` / `'low'`.

2. **`additionalProperties`** — strict structured output started failing:
   > `Invalid JSON payload received. Unknown name "additionalProperties" at 'generation_config.response_schema': Cannot find field.`

   Every LLM-Process schema set `additionalProperties: false` (required by OpenAI strict mode); the proxy's Gemini `response_schema` path does not recognise the key.

Both affected **all** LLM-Process predictors (continuous, binary, categorical) across every use case, since they share the completion seam — the S&P 500 work just surfaced them first.

### Fix

- **`additionalProperties`:** strip it centrally and recursively in
  `make_json_schema_response_format` (`_client.py`), keeping `strict: true`. One
  seam fixes every predictor. (If a direct OpenAI-strict route is ever added, it
  would need `additionalProperties: false` restored for that path.)
- **`reasoning_effort`:** the library default and the food / BoC recipe defaults
  moved from `'disable'` / `'low'` to **`None`** (provider default — sends no
  `reasoning_effort`; the lite model does not force chain-of-thought, preserving
  the calibration intent). The `'disable'`/`'low'` literals are retained on the
  type for non-proxy providers but will 400 through the proxy.

### Takeaway

The proxy's accepted parameter vocabulary and JSON-schema dialect can change under you; prefer the **provider default (`None`)** for `reasoning_effort` unless a model is known to need a specific budget, and keep response schemas to the lowest-common-denominator JSON-Schema the Gemini `response_schema` path accepts (no `additionalProperties`).

## History: `gemini-3.5-flash` rejects a thinking budget of 0 (September 2026)

### What happened

The `search_web` tool's independent leakage verifier (`_verify_no_leakage` in
`agent_factory.py`), which defaults to `verifier_model=ADVANCED_MODEL`
(`gemini-3.5-flash`), started failing every call through the proxy with:

> `litellm.BadRequestError: ... "message": "Budget 0 is invalid. This model only works in thinking mode."`

### Root cause

Unlike the lite model, `gemini-3.5-flash` has no non-thinking mode — it always
requires a non-zero thinking budget. Neither `_verify_no_leakage` nor
`_do_search` ever set `reasoning_effort`/`extra_body`, so when routed through
the proxy the request carried no thinking directive at all and the proxy
defaulted to a thinking budget of `0`, which this model rejects outright
(same param-stripping mechanism as the "`reasoning_effort` silently dropped"
issue above — `drop_params=True` strips it from the OpenAI-compatible path
because `gemini-3.5-flash` doesn't look like an o1/o3 model).

### Fix

`_verify_no_leakage` now injects `reasoning_effort="minimal"` via `extra_body`
whenever `openai_base_url` is set, following the same `extra_body` workaround
used in `_client.py`. `_do_search` was left unchanged: its `search_model`
defaults to `LITE_MODEL`, which intentionally omits `reasoning_effort`
(provider default) per the takeaway above.

### Takeaway

The confirmed `reasoning_effort` vocabulary above (`None`/`minimal`/`medium`/`high`)
was only verified against `gemini-3.1-flash-lite-preview`. Whether
`gemini-3.5-flash` accepts the same values through the proxy is not yet
confirmed empirically — treat `"minimal"` as a starting point to verify once
quota allows, not a settled proxy contract. If a model is thinking-only
(no non-thinking mode), any code path that calls it directly via
`litellm.acompletion` on the proxy must set an explicit non-zero
`reasoning_effort`; omitting the field is not a safe default for those models.
